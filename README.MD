# PhotoBook - A Photo A Day

## Description

PhotoBook is a combination of a photo album and a diary which enables you to write a private journal and record memories. You can include not only what happened, when it happened, and where it happened, but also your feelings and opinions. Take a photo once a day, may it be a selfie, what you did for today, or even a simple thing that stood out today. Write about your day, or what that photo means, or whatever ideas or inspiration you may come up with, you are free to do it all.
Your photos will be stored in a database in full quality, to ensure that you don’t lose or misplace your photos. Create albums dedicated to a single theme or project, so you won’t be limited to having only one photobook. This app allows you to save memories and remember events that happened that day, giving you a better appreciation of the bigger or smaller things in life. You can keep daily reflections, pour out your feelings, keep a gratitude list, create a journaling habit, track your achievements, and so much more!

## Features

-   Notification and Reminders
    Users tend to forget things. There would be notifications and reminders to remind the users to document their day. This would encourage the users to take pictures and write down about something.

-   Capture and Save
    Capture the moment and take photos anytime, anywhere. Users can take photos seamlessly through the app. Users can also upload their own photo directly to the app if they wish to.

-   Create albums and diaries
    Just like organizing files, you can create a separate photo album in case you want to have another album separate to your main one. This can include selfies, objects, events, objects, art, and so on. The possibilities are endless!
